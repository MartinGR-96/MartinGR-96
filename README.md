- Hi! My name is Martin Ramirez and I'm from Mendoza Argentina.

- Currently I'm studying programming in college with the intention of becoming a software developer (although I also have my sights on data engineering)

- I'm interested in data engineering, data science, Java, Python, R and SQL.

- You can get in touch with me with an email at martingr1996@gmail.com 

- There's not much else to tell right now, I still have a long way to go!

Have a good one :)
